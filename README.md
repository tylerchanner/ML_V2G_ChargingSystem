This project focuses on optimizing Electric Vehicle (EV) charging and discharging schedules using a combination of Machine Learning (LSTM models) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. The primary objective is to forecast renewable energy (solar and wind) availability using time-series data, then optimize energy flow between EVs and the grid based on real-time demand. This helps stabilize the grid, reduce energy costs, and enhance energy efficiency.

Key Features:
LSTM Model for Renewable Energy Forecasting: A neural network is used to predict renewable energy generation, assisting in decision-making for EV charging.
V2G Optimization: An optimization algorithm determines the best times to charge or discharge EVs based on energy predictions and grid demand.
API Integration: Real-time data is fetched from external APIs (like OpenWeatherMap) to improve the accuracy of forecasts.
EV and Grid Interaction: The project includes a system to allow EVs to return energy to the grid during high-demand periods, improving grid stability.
Scalable Infrastructure: Built for integration with external APIs and cloud services for scalability in real-world deployment.
